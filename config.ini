# Linear Movement
max_speed = 150.00              # units/second at full throttle
acceleration = 32.00            # units/second² (balanced for 3-4s to max speed)
deceleration = 1.00             # units/second² (natural water friction)
reverse_speed_multiplier = 0.35  # reverse is 35% of forward speed
reverse_accel_multiplier = 0.50  # reverse acceleration is 50% of forward

# Rotational Movement
max_turn_rate = 24.00           # degrees/second (tuned for ≥400 unit turn radius)
turn_accel = 80.00              # degrees/second² (turn builds up smoothly)
speed_turn_factor = 0.65        # turning effectiveness at low speed (65% at stop)

# Momentum & Drift  
coast_friction = 0.012          # friction coefficient when throttle released (smooth, gradual coast)
drift_factor = 0.30             # how much ship drifts outward in turns (increased for visible drift)
momentum_retention = 0.90       # per-frame momentum retention (smoother coast)

# Responsiveness
throttle_response_time = 0.15   # seconds to respond to throttle input (was 0.40 - much faster)
steering_response_time = 0.25   # seconds to respond to steering input
