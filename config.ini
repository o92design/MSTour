# Linear Movement
max_speed = 150.00              # units/second at full throttle
acceleration = 45.00           # units/second² (reaches max in ~3 seconds)
deceleration = 2.00           # units/second² (natural water friction)
reverse_speed_multiplier = 0.35  # reverse is 35% of forward speed
reverse_accel_multiplier = 0.50  # reverse acceleration is 50% of forward

# Rotational Movement
max_turn_rate = 40.00          # degrees/second at full speed
turn_accel = 80.00             # degrees/second² (turn builds up smoothly)
speed_turn_factor = 0.65      # turning effectiveness at low speed (65% at stop)

# Momentum & Drift
coast_friction = 0.015        # friction coefficient when throttle released
drift_factor = 0.25           # how much ship drifts outward in turns (0=none, 1=full)
momentum_retention = 0.96     # per-frame momentum retention (creates coasting)

# Responsiveness
throttle_response_time = 0.40 # seconds to respond to throttle input
steering_response_time = 0.25 # seconds to respond to steering input
