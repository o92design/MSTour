## 🎨 Unique Design Elements

### "Business Management with Heart"
Unlike typical management sims, MS Tour humanizes every system:
- Passengers have names, traits, personalities
- Employees are individuals with skills and stories
- Family (wife, children) are deeply integrated
- Historical figures (VIPs) have authentic characterization

### Three-Act Life Story
The narrative spanning 60 years creates:
- Complete character arc (youth → patriarch)
- Progressive complexity (learning → mastery → legacy)
- Emotional investment (building → maintaining → passing on)
- Historical immersion (1887 → 1950s)

### Skill-Based Management Hybrid
Combines:
- Direct piloting (WASD control, moment-to-moment skill)
- Strategic planning (route design, fleet optimization)
- Narrative choices (family, succession, relationships)

### Data-Oriented Design
Technical approach ensures:
- 60 FPS with 50+ ships
- Efficient batch processing
- Scalable to large fleets
- Performance-conscious from design stage

---

## 📋 Remaining Work

### Documents to Create: 51+ additional
### Estimated Time: 20-25 weeks at 2-3 docs/week

**Breakdown**:
- Phase 1 Priority: 7 documents (2-3 weeks)
- Phase 2 Priority: 11 documents (4-5 weeks)
- Phase 3 Priority: 14 documents (5-6 weeks)
- Phase 4 Priority: 14 documents (5-6 weeks)
- Phase 5 Priority: 8+ documents (3-4 weeks)

## ✨ What Makes This GDD Special

### Not Just Mechanics
Every system serves the player fantasy: *"I am a shipping captain who built an empire with my own hands and lived a full life."*

### Complete Experience Design
From minute-to-minute piloting to 60-year life narrative, every scale of gameplay is considered and integrated.

### Implementation-First
Documents are written for developers to implement, not just for designers to discuss. Formulas, parameters, edge cases, and success metrics are all specified.

### Emotionally Resonant
"Till havs" and the deathbed framing transform a management sim into a life story. Players should feel they've *lived* something, not just played something.

### Historically Grounded
1887 Sweden, real VIPs, authentic events. The setting is not just flavor—it's integrated into gameplay and narrative.

## 🎵 The Heart of MS Tour

*"Till havs, till havs, till livets kamp och fara..."*

This GDD captures not just mechanics and systems, but a vision: a game about life, legacy, and the sea. A game where players feel they've built something meaningful, raised a family, lived through history, and left a mark that endures.

The sea awaits. Let's build something memorable.
