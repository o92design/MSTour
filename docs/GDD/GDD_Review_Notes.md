**Ship Propulsion System Redesign Completed:**
- ✅ Sailing ships removed from design (historically inaccurate for commercial passenger ferries)
- ✅ Steam → Diesel engine progression implemented
- ✅ Created comprehensive [Ship Propulsion and Engine Systems](https://o92design.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MS/pages/2588673) GDD page
- ✅ Updated GDD Master with engine-ship separation model
- ✅ Updated Quick Reference with diesel unlock timeline (1910+)
- ✅ Engine marketplace system designed (shipyard facility upgrade + mechanic skills)
- ✅ Historical timeline integrated (1887-1950s steam to diesel transition)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Engine-ship separation: Ships are hulls upgradeable with different engines
- Two-layer unlock: Player shipyard upgrade (1910+) + mechanic skill progression
- Four-tier mechanic skills (Novice/Trained/Proficient/Expert) affecting upgrade time, maintenance, fuel efficiency
- Diesel prestige bonus scaled by era (early adopter rewards)
- Act 1 starter: Small steam commuter ferry (not sailing ship)
