## Overview

MS Tour's narrative spans approximately 60 years (1887-1950s) divided into three distinct acts, each lasting 5-10 hours of gameplay. The structure follows classical dramatic theory while integrating progressive gameplay systems. The entire story is framed as a **deathbed reflection**, with the protagonist (Grand-papa or Grand-mama) reliving their life's journey.

## Design Intent

**Narrative Goals**:
1. **Emotional Arc**: Create a complete life story with beginning, peak, and resolution
2. **Progressive Challenge**: Each act increases complexity and stakes
3. **Thematic Resonance**: Life themes (youth, success, legacy) mirror gameplay evolution
4. **Historical Integration**: Real events create dramatic tension and context
5. **Player Agency**: Choices matter, especially in succession and endings

**Design Philosophy** (Jesse Schell):
- Three-act structure creates natural pacing and rhythm
- Each act should feel distinct in tone, challenge, and gameplay
- Emotional beats transform mechanical progression into memorable story

## Framing Device: Deathbed Reflection

### Opening Scene (Prologue)

**Setting**: A dim bedroom, 1950s  
**Characters**: Elderly protagonist (Grand-papa/Grand-mama), gathered family  
**Atmosphere**: Nostalgic, bittersweet, peaceful

**Scene Description**:
```
[Camera: Close-up of wrinkled hands holding a faded photograph of a ship]

NARRATOR (elderly, reflective):
"Till havs, till havs..." 
[Music: "Till havs" begins softly on piano]

"They're all here now. My children, my grandchildren. 
Good that they came. There are things I need to tell them—
about the sea, about ships, about a life lived in the archipelago."

[Camera: Pans to show family gathered around bed]

WIFE (elderly, warm):
"Tell them about the beginning, älskling. Tell them about 
that young captain with more ambition than sense."

PROTAGONIST (chuckles weakly):
"That captain... yes. Let me tell you about 1887, 
when I first set foot on a ship of my own..."

[Screen fades to white, "Till havs" swells]
[Fade in: Gothenburg harbor, 1887, vibrant and bustling]
```

**Purpose**:
- Establish emotional framing (nostalgia, reflection)
- Introduce "Till havs" as the emotional anchor
- Set expectation: this is a life story, beginning to end
- Create mystery: What legacy will be left? Who will inherit?

### Interstitial Narration (Between Acts)

Throughout gameplay, the elderly narrator occasionally interjects:
- "I should have seen the storm coming..."
- "That was the summer everything changed."
- "I didn't know it then, but that decision would define us."

These moments:
- Bridge time gaps between acts
- Foreshadow events
- Add dramatic irony (player knows outcome)
- Maintain framing device presence

### Closing Scene (Epilogue)

**Setting**: Same bedroom, moments later in story time  
**Resolution**: Final words, family gathered, peaceful passing

*Detailed in Act 3 section*

## Design Notes

> **On Emotional Beats**: Story moments should never interrupt active gameplay (voyages). They occur between voyages in harbor or planning room. This preserves player agency while allowing narrative space.

> **On Player Choice**: While much of the story is fixed (historical events, aging, death), player choices matter in: relationship dialogues, business decisions, and especially succession. The ending variations make replayability viable.

> **On Historical Sensitivity**: WWI and WWII are treated with appropriate gravity. No glorification, focus on civilian/economic impacts. Protagonist is not combatant, observes from business perspective.

> **On Death**: The protagonist's death is always peaceful (no violent deaths). This is a life well-lived story, not a tragedy. Even "bad" endings have dignity.
